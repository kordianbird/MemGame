# UX

## User Stories

* as a player I want to be able to play the game on any device

* as a player I want to be aware of my score

* as a player I want to experience the game without any issues

## Design

* Each tile has it's own color in order to stand out from each other

* tiles were made to look more like cards to avoid looking similar to other simon games

* the score, level and taps are located in the same area so that the player will not be getting distracted

* the main menu let's players see their latest score before starting their next game

* all tiles are located close to each other making it easier to read the sequence

* the background image sets a nice atmosphere
